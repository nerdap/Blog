At the end of the community bonding period, Andreas and I went through the product backlog, adding demoables, sizing and reordering items, and adding and reorganizing themes. It was an interesting exercise because it helped me fully understand the complexity of the project and plan my future weeks better.

And so began the GSoC coding period. The first theme I'm working on concerns the design and core infrastructure of the new visual test system. I didn't make as much progress as I wanted to this week but I feel it's a reasonable start.

Progress so far:

* Product backlog is [up](https://github.com/nerdap/autotestsprite2/wiki/Product-Backlog)
* Set up a Bitbucket [repository](https://bitbucket.org/nerdap/sdlvisualtest)
* A [design document](https://github.com/nerdap/autotestsprite2/wiki/Test-system-design) is ready, but it's still a work in progress. I'll be adding more details soon.
* Wrote a simple test harness for windows that launches a process (passed as a command line parameter) and returns the exit code.
* Created a Visual Studio 2012 solution to build the project; makefiles are coming soon.

What's next?

* Make/Configure scripts so we can build on Linux.
* Adding a Doxygen make target.
* Adding Linux support in the test harness.
* Updating the design document with more details.
